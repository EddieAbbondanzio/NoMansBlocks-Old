No Mans Blocks
=====

Summary
-----
My personal passion project that may never be done. I'm exploring the challenging task of building a voxel game engine and have fun along the way. Someday I hope to release the game as free to play, and build a small community.

Vision
-----
This project aims to be a successor to the popular Ace of Spades beta. By beta I mean before Jagex took over and turned the game into a pile of rubbish. While No Mans Blocks will not be a full clone, it will draw some of it's key elements from Ace of Spades.

I hope to include more of a BattleField feel with the addition of vehicles and large scale map destruction. However all of this is quite the large task for a solo indie developer, and I can't make any promises.
